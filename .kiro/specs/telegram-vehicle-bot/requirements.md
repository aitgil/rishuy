# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Telegram bot that allows users to input an Israeli vehicle license plate number and receive comprehensive vehicle information. The bot will integrate with the official Israeli government data API (data.gov.il) to fetch vehicle registration data and disability parking permit information. The bot should provide a user-friendly interface with buttons and interactive elements, defaulting to Hebrew language with customizable user settings for data display preferences.

3. WHEN no vehicle data is found THEN the bot SHALL inform the user that no information was found for the provided license plate
4. IF the license plate format is invalid THEN the bot SHALL prompt the user to enter a valid Israeli license plate format

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my searches to be processed quickly, so that I don't have to wait long for results.

3. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN the bot SHALL process them efficiently to minimize response time

### Requirement 6

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize which vehicle data fields are displayed, so that I can see only the information that interests me.
